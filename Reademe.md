# Intro To Redux 

Youâ€™ve built your foundation in state management â€” now itâ€™s time to wield one of the most powerful tools in the React ecosystem: Redux.



In this module, weâ€™ll explore the why behind Redux, understand its architecture, and demystify how it works under the hood. From grasping unidirectional vs bi-directional data flow, to breaking down the Flux pattern, to setting up your first Redux store and slice â€” weâ€™ve got it all covered.

ðŸ’¡ Whether Redux once felt too abstract or over-engineered, this module will change that.



By the end, you'll not only be able to set up and use Redux confidently but also understand exactly why and when it makes sense to use it.
